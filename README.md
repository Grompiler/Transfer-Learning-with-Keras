## Example: train the model and classify an image

```python
'''we have only two functions in the code (train and classify) to make it easy to use'''
>>> train() # will train the model and save it to 'My_resNet50_weights.h5' by default
>>> classify('path/to/image') # just replace the path with one image of bottle you want to classify
```
